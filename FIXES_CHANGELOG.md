## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. ACF Table Values - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Temporal Dependency ACF table showed "nan" for all ACF lags 1, 5, 10, and 20 for all models.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced manual ACF computation with `statsmodels.tsa.stattools.acf`
- Used parameters: `unbiased=False, fft=True`
- Extracted exact values at specific lags: 1, 5, 10, 20
- Populated table with 6 significant figures

**Results:**
- **GARCH**: Lag1: 0.020907, Lag5: -0.004834, Lag10: -0.053998, Lag20: 0.075786
- **DDPM**: Lag1: -0.038115, Lag5: -0.020246, Lag10: -0.013910, Lag20: 0.008299
- **TimeGrad**: Lag1: -0.012815, Lag5: -0.017539, Lag10: -0.004684, Lag20: 0.002486
- **LLM-Conditioned**: Lag1: -0.005805, Lag5: 0.003630, Lag10: 0.002817, Lag20: -0.001194

**File Updated:** `results/comprehensive_evaluation/evaluation_results_enhanced_fixed.json`

---

### 2. Sample Sequence Captions - CLARIFIED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Captions were unclear about number of samples and contained stray "Sample 1" labels.

**Solution:**
- Updated caption to: "Five independently sampled sequences (length 60) overlaid; real data segment shown for reference. Seeds recorded in methodology for reproducibility."
- Removed stray "Sample 1" labels from legends
- Maintained shared y-axis limits across all models
- Kept fixed seeds (42-46) for reproducibility

**Implementation:** Updated `create_fixed_sample_sequence_comparisons()` function

---

### 3. Heavy-Tails Visual - ADDED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Missing visual analysis of LLM-Conditioned model's heavy tails.

**Solution:**
- Created compact heavy-tails visual with two panels
- **Left Panel**: Distribution overlay restricted to 99.5th percentile range
- **Right Panel**: Top 5 absolute returns comparison table
- Added vertical lines for 99.5th percentiles
- Included explanation: "Heavy tails drive higher kurtosis and can affect ranking when tail-sensitive metrics and independence tests are emphasised."

**Visual Elements:**
- Distribution overlay with 99.5th percentile markers
- Bar chart comparing top 5 absolute returns
- Current kurtosis values displayed
- Consistent styling with existing plots

---

### 4. Right-Tail Zoom Plots - ADDED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Missing right-tail (gains) analysis to mirror left-tail (losses) plots.

**Solution:**
- Created right-tail zoom plots using identical binning and axis ranges
- **X-axis Range**: 0 to 99.9th percentile (positive values only)
- **Binning**: 25 bins for consistent resolution
- **Styling**: Green color scheme to differentiate from left-tail red
- **Placement**: Immediately after left-tail panels in "Tail Analysis" section

**Implementation:** New `create_right_tail_zoom_plots()` function

---

### 5. Executive Summary - UPDATED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Missing explanation for ranking change from previous report version.

**Solution:**
- Added clear ranking change explanation under "Key Findings"
- **Text**: "Compared to the prior version, incorporating independence tests, calibration plots with exact confidence intervals, and explicit temporal-dependency checks slightly altered the ranking. TimeGrad moves to first overall due to stronger temporal behaviour and stable distribution match; the LLM-Conditioned model retains excellent VaR calibration but exhibits heavier tails, which weighs more under the enhanced evaluation framework."

**Context:** References new backtesting and temporal-dependency results

---

### 6. Title Formatting - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Main titles on page 1 and page 11 overlapped with body text.

**Solution:**
- Adjusted title positioning with proper `pad` and `y` parameters
- Increased spacing above and below titles
- Maintained consistent font sizes and weights
- Ensured clear separation between headings and paragraphs

**Pages Fixed:**
- **Page 1**: Executive Summary title spacing
- **Page 11**: Temporal Dependency Analysis title spacing
